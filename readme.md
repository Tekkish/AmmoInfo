# AmmoInfo

Displays a list containing the current ammo counts of your weapons. It's best used with gameplay mods that don't already reveal this information. You can personalize abbreviations, alignment, colorization, opacity, and positioning. It also works with base Doom, Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.
